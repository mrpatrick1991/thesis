\chapter{Experiment Data and Analysis}

\section{Overview of The Balloon Experiments}

High altitude balloons have an extensive heritage as platforms for experiments that take place in the upper atmosphere. In this chapter we will examine results from three balloon flight campaigns which carried X-ray spectrometers. The results of the previous two chapters will be applied to determine as much information about the causative precipitating electrons as possible, while avoiding over-fitting the available data. The total precipitating flux and energy distribution of the electrons will be the main targets. The experiments on the balloon flights that we use in this chapter were all equipped with NaI scintillator detectors, and the analysis will be framed around the data that can be obtained from them. There will be questions that can be answered using detectors of a different design, particularly, those sensitive to the angular distribution of the incoming photons. These will be discussed at the end and left for future work. 

The balloon flights used in this analysis were from the following campaigns.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| } 
\hline
Project Name & Location & Active & Primary Reference \\
\hline
$\text{ABOVE}^2$ & Saskatoon, Saskatchewan & Summer 2016 & None Current\\
\hline
BARREL & Antarctica & 2013-2014 & \citet{Millan2014}\\
\hline
EPEX & Fort MacMurray, Alberta & Summer 2018 & None Current\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The campaigns each consisted of a number of flights. Each had a somewhat different scientific target, which will be discussed in their analysis sections, however, all of them carried NaI scintillation detectors of a similar design, which we can use with the results from the previous two chapters. We will begin with a discussion of the detector design and operating principles. 

\section{Detector Design}

The sodium iodide scintillation detector carried by flights on all three balloon campaigns was designed by Dr. Michael McCarthy at the University of Washington, Seattle campus. The instrument design has a heritage extending back to~\citet{winckler}. The instrument specifications follow, reproduced from~\citet{Millan2014}.

Simulations completed with GEANT3 (the predecessor to GEANT4) indicate that the detector behaves as essentially uncollimated, though the view through the atmosphere results in it having a field of view of approximately 60 degrees~\citet{Millan2014}. 

A picture of the detector as flown on the $\text{ABOVE}^2$ campaign is shown in Figure~\ref{detector_picture}. The unit is cylindrical, standing on a plexiglass mount and standing approximately 30 cm tall. The cylinder includes the NaI scintillation crystal, photomultiplier tube, and optical coupling. X-rays deposit their energy in the NaI crystal, and a fraction of the resulting light pulse is converted to a voltage pulse by the photomultiplier tube~\citet{Millan2014}. This voltage pulse is then converted to a digital value proportional to the deposited energy by the DPU and output on a serial port for processing and storage by the rest of the flight system. The disconnected wire harnesses visible in Figure~\ref{detector_picture} connect the detector to the various support hardware included with the flight system. Temperature sensors and heaters were used to maintain the detector temperature at 15 deg. C during the flight. Power was provided by an array of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, which are contained in the rectangular foam box behind the detector in Figure~\ref{detector_picture}.

The detector sends measurements to a serial port as digital data. The outputs, reproduced from~\citet{Millan2014}, follow.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| }
\hline
Product & Cadence & Energy Range (keV) & No. of Energy Channels \\
\hline
Rate Counters & 4 & - & - \\
Fast Spectra & 0.05 & 20-1500 & 4 \\
Medium Spectra & 4 & 100-4000 & 48 \\
Slow Spectra & 32 & 20-10000 & 256 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For the EPEX and $\text{ABOVE}^2$ campaigns, the instruments were designed to be recovered, and the data were recorded to onboard storage, with some telemetered results as a backup. For the BARREL campaign, the logistics involved in recovering all the payloads are difficult. While a subset were recovered, most were not, and the data were telemetered using an iridium satellite modem. For these flights, the analysis uses the data products published at NASA CDAWEB. The primary citation for this data set is~\citet{Millan2014}.

The functional layout of the detector is shown in the block diagram of Figure~\ref{detector_block_diagram}, which is reproduced from~\citet{Millan2014}.

\section{The $\text{ABOVE}^2$ Campaign}


The $\text{ABOVE}^2$ balloon campaign was flown during the Summer of 2016. There were three flights, each using zero-pressure balloons manufactured by Near-Space Corporation, and designed for a float altitude of greater than 33 kilometers. The first flight was done to validate the operational aspects of the balloon system and telemetry. Flights 2 and 3 were equipped with the X-ray spectrometer. Flight 2 did not see any X-rays besides the expected background, however flight 3 observed a precipitation event that lasted several minutes. Unfortunately, flight 3 had to be flown using the X-ray spectrometer recovered from flight 2, due to an error during installation which damaged the flight 3 spectrometer. This normally wouldn't be a problem, except that the landing under parachute at the end of flight 2 created a shock which was later found to have damaged the crystal, and potentially the optical coupling between the crystal and photomultiplier tube. The effect of these defects is difficult to fully quantify post-flight, except to note that the energy calibration of the detector certainly changes. Further, damage to the optical coupling between the crystal and the photmultiplier tube will result in fewer photons created in the crystal reaching the photomultiplier tube, which will effectively reduce the detector sensitivity. These effects degrade the accuracy and precision of the results from the third $\text{ABOVE}^2$ flight, an effect which will be amplified during the application of the inversion techniques discussed in Chapter~4. Despite these problems, there is still value in examining the data set. The location, timing, and relative amplitudes of the X-ray event are intact, and a comparison between the observed X-ray flux and measurements from a nearby VLF (very low frequency) receiver site shows a strong, though not unexpected, correlation. Figure~\ref{abv2_launch} shows $\text{ABOVE}^2$ science flight 2 being prepared for launch.

    \caption{$\text{ABOVE}^2$ X-ray detector counts per second, summed across all energy channels, as a function of time since power-on of the system.}
    \label{abv2_counts}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{abv2_counts} shows the total counts recorded by the X-ray spectrometer on science flight 2 as a function of time. The profile follows a shape which is characteristic of this type of experiment. After power-on and while the detector is still on the ground, the total counts are roughly constant. Once the balloon is launched, the detector is removed from naturally occurring radioactive materials in the ground, and the count rate decreases. As altitude increases during the ascent, the count rate starts to increase, because the atmosphere, which acts as a shield from natural radiation from space, begins to decrease in density. After the balloon reaches equilibrium with the atmosphere, the count rates are again roughly constant. On descent, the reverse of this process occurs. The precipitation event observed by science flight 2 happens at approximately 400 minutes from power-on, and lasts for approximately 20 minutes.

In order to apply the techniques of Chapter 4, an energy spectrum of the X-rays produced by the precipitation event is required. A background-subtracted spectrum is shown in Figure~\ref{abv2_hist}
