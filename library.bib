   abstract = {The Balloon Array for Radiation belt Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) studies the loss of energetic electrons from Earth's radiation belts. BARREL's array of slowly drifting balloon payloads was designed to capitalize on magnetic conjunctions with NASA's Van Allen Probes. Two campaigns were conducted from Antarctica in 2013 and 2014. During the first campaign in January and February of 2013, there were three moderate geomagnetic storms with SYM-Hmin<-40nT. Similarly, two minor geomagnetic storms occurred during the second campaign, starting in December of 2013 and continuing on into February of 2014. Throughout the two campaigns, BARREL observed electron precipitation over a wide range of energies and exhibiting temporal structure from hundreds of milliseconds to hours. Relativistic electron precipitation was observed in the dusk to midnight sector, and microburst precipitation was primarily observed near dawn. In this paper we review the two BARREL science campaigns and discuss the data products and analysis techniques as applied to relativistic electron precipitation observed on 19 January 2013.},

Millan et al. nity, BARREL augments the Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission by providing measure-ments of relativistic electron precipitation with a pair of Antarctic balloon campaigns that will be conducted during the Austral summers (January-February) of 2013 and 2014. Dur-ing each campaign, a total of 20 small (∼20 kg) stratospheric balloons will be successively launched to maintain an array of ∼5 payloads spread across ∼6 hours of magnetic local time in the region that magnetically maps to the radiation belts. Each balloon carries an X-ray spectrometer to measure the bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by precipitating rela-tivistic electrons as they collide with neutrals in the atmosphere, and a DC magnetometer to measure ULF-timescale variations of the magnetic field. BARREL will provide the first balloon measurements of relativistic electron precipitation while comprehensive in situ mea-surements of both plasma waves and energetic particles are available, and will characterize the spatial scale of precipitation at relativistic energies. All data and analysis software will be made freely available to the scientific community.},

All events were consistent with emission at the trapping boundary; observations over the polar cap showed no precipitation. We present the first high-resolution ($Δ$E\{\textasciitilde\}2 keV/full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectra of this hard X-ray emission in the energy range 20-300 keV.

The new model and the associated NRLMSIS database now include the following data: (1) total mass density from satellite accelerometers and from orbit determination (including the Jacchia and Barlier data sets), (2) temperature from incoherent scatter radar covering 1981-1997, and (3) molecular oxygen number density, [O2], from solar ultraviolet occultation aboard the Solar Maximum Mission. A new component, "anomalous oxygen," allows for appreciable O+ and hot atomic oxygen contributions to the total mass density at high altitudes and applies primarily to drag estimation above 500 km. Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-OO, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia70 over a wide range of F10.7 Considering the two regimes together, NRLMSISE-00 achieves an improvement over both MSISE-90 and Jacchia-70 by incorporating advantages of each.

To improve the assessments of precipitating electrons using X-ray measurements requires deeper understanding of bremsstrahlung production, transport, and redistribution throughout the atmosphere. Here we use first-principles Monte Carlo models to explore relativistic electron precipitation events from the perspective of bremsstrahlung X-rays. The spatial distribution of X-rays is quantified from the ground level up to satellite altitudes. We then simulate X-ray images that would be captured using an ideal camera and calculate the energy spectra of X-rays originating from monoenergetic beams of precipitating electrons. Moreover, we show how these impulse responses to monoenergetic beams can be used to reconstruct the precipitating source using an inversion technique. Modeling results show that space-borne measurements of backscattered X-rays provide a promising method to estimate precipitation spatial size, fluxes, and spectra.},

   abstract = {The subject of this book is stratospheric balloons used for scientific observations and for the development of space technology and balloons that are used for aerological observations. These balloons attain flight altitudes more than three times those of passenger planes. They transport payloads ranging from several hundred kilograms up to several tons into the earth's stratosphere. The density of the atmosphere at these altitudes is less than 1% that at the earth's surface. In addition, as part of planetary exploration, this book includes planetary balloons sent to float over other planets that have atmospheres, such as Mars and Venus. The general term used to describe these sorts of activities is scientific ballooning. Although the flights of stratospheric balloons used for various scientific observations and technological experiments do not take place in the void of space, stratospheric balloons may be placed in the same fields as rockets and satellites, namely space science and technology. This, of course, goes without saying for planetary balloons that are transported into outer space on space vehicles. Organizations that conduct research and development, and that launch and perform operations with this type of scientific ballooning are usually associated with each country's meteorological organizations and space research and development organizations. Stratospheric balloons are giant pressurized membrane structures that float in the thin atmosphere of the stratosphere. Their volumes range from a few tens of thousands of cubic meters up to several hundred thousand cubic meters. Their flight characteristics are governed by complex relationships of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. For planetary balloons, various atmospheric conditions that differ from those on the ground also come into effect. Consequently, performing systematic engineering design and analysis is a prerequisite for constructing and launching balloons. Aerological knowledge of the atmosphere is indispensable for conducting a flight. Such a foundation also ensures safety and reliability during flights. The aim of this book is to systematically describe the engineering aspects associated with scientific ballooning. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009. All rights reserved.},

The main idea is to consider the signal as a sum of two components: a piecewise constant component and a smooth component. For the solution of ill-posed problems, the Tikhonov method with a special stabilizer in the form of a sum of two different stabilizers is used: the total variation for the first component and the Sobolev norm for the second one. An iteratively re-weighted least squares technique is used as a fast and an efficient algorithm for minimization of the Tikhonov functional. A method is also presented for determining the regularization parameters. Numerical experiments, among the many performed, in denoising, deblurring, and compressed sensing demonstrate high performance of the new regularization for reconstruction of piecewise-smooth solutions with sharp discontinuities. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Auroral substorms, dynamic phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere at night, are caused by global reconfiguration of the magnetosphere, which releases stored solar wind energy. These storms are characterized by auroral brightening from dusk to midnight, followed by violent motions of distinct auroral arcs that suddenly break up, and the subsequent emergence of diffuse, pulsating auroral patches at dawn. Pulsating aurorae, which are quasiperiodic, blinking patches of light tens to hundreds of kilometres across, appear at altitudes of about 100 kilometres in the high-latitude regions of both hemispheres, and multiple patches often cover the entire sky. This auroral pulsation, with periods of several to tens of seconds, is generated by the intermittent precipitation of energetic electrons (several to tens of kiloelectronvolts) arriving from the magnetosphere and colliding with the atoms and molecules of the upper atmosphere. A possible cause of this precipitation is the interaction between magnetospheric electrons and electromagnetic waves called whistler-mode chorus waves. However, no direct observational evidence of this interaction has been obtained so far. Here we report that energetic electrons are scattered by chorus waves, resulting in their precipitation. Our observations were made in March 2017 with a magnetospheric spacecraft equipped with a high-angular-resolution electron sensor and electromagnetic field instruments. The measured quasiperiodic precipitating electron flux was sufficiently intense to generate a pulsating aurora, which was indeed simultaneously observed by a ground auroral imager.},

The TPM, along with other hardware, can implement a cloaked computation, whose memory state cannot be observed by any other software, including the operating system and hypervisor. We show that malware can use cloaked computations to hide essential secrets (like the target of an attack) from a malware analyst. We describe and implement a protocol that establishes an encryption key under control of the TPM that can only be used by a specific infection program. An infected host then proves the legitimacy of this key to a remote malware distribution platform, and receives and executes an encrypted payload in a way that prevents software visibility of the decrypted payload. We detail how malware can benefit from cloaked computations and discuss defenses against our protocol. Hardening legitimate uses of the TPM against attack improves the resilience of our malware, creating a Catch-22 for secure computing technology.},

   abstract = {The precipitating kiloelectronvolt electrons in the auroral zone that produce enhanced E-region ionization also produce bremsstrahlung X-rays. The spectral distribution of the emitted X-rays contains information from which the energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons may be inferred. Modeling of the interaction of auroral electrons with the atmosphere shows that the flux F of vertically-emitted X-rays as a function of energy K is given approximately by F(K) = g1(K) ∫ K ∞ (E - K)J(E)dE where J(E) is the differential flux of electrons in the energy range E - E + dE and g1(K) is a modified X-ray production function. With this functional form for the production function the quantity F(K) g1(K) is an exponential if the electron distribution is exponential. Thus, by dividing the observed X-ray fluxes at energy K by g1(K) and fitting the result to an exponential function, the average energy and energy flux of the electron distribution can be determined directly. The technique is especially useful for determining ionospheric properties that depend on the integral of the electron fluxes, for example, the total energy flux, the E-region peak density and the height-integrated electrical conductances. The best-fit exponential electron spectrum yields values for these parameters that are very nearly the same as the values computed from the actual spectrum, even though the actual spectrum may deviate substantially from an exponential. Accurate knowledge of the function g1 (K) is important in applying the technique to observations. For X-ray fluxes emitted at an escape angle of 180° from the nadir direction and assuming an isotroplc distribution of incident electrons g1(K) is approximately equal to 1.96 × 10-5 K-1.9 when energies are expressed in kiloelectronvolts. The values derived here for g1(K) agree well with those derived from simultaneous measurements of electron fluxes and resulting X-ray bremsstrahlung emission. © 1989.},

Bremsstrahlung hard X-ray emission extending up to \{\textasciitilde\}300 keV, from the precipitation of high-energy electrons, was observed on six separate occasions over the auroral zone, all during low geomagnetic activity (Kp<=2+). All events were consistent with emission at the trapping boundary; observations over the polar cap showed no precipitation. We present the first high-resolution ($Δ$E\{\textasciitilde\}2 keV/full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectra of this hard X-ray emission in the energy range 20-300 keV. The observed count spectra are deconvolved by model-independent techniques to photon spectra and then the precipitating electron spectra.

   abstract = {Earth's diffuse aurora occurs over a broad latitude range and is primarily caused by the precipitation of low-energy (0.1-30-keV) electrons originating in the central plasma sheet, which is the source region for hot electrons in the nightside outer magnetosphere. Although generally not visible, the diffuse auroral precipitation provides the main source of energy for the high-latitude nightside upper atmosphere, leading to enhanced ionization and chemical changes. Previous theoretical studies have indicated that two distinct classes of magnetospheric plasma wave, electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves and whistler-mode chorus waves, could be responsible for the electron scattering that leads to diffuse auroral precipitation, but it has hitherto not been possible to determine which is the more important. Here we report an analysis of satellite wave data and Fokker-Planck diffusion calculations which reveals that scattering by chorus is the dominant cause of the most intense diffuse auroral precipitation. This resolves a long-standing controversy. Furthermore, scattering by chorus can remove most electrons as they drift around Earth's magnetosphere, leading to the development of observed pancake distributions, and can account for the global morphology of the diffuse aurora. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {We present in this paper multi-instrumental observations and analyses of fast earthward flows, electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves, and diffuse auroras, during 8-9 UT on February 5, 2009. The event began with a series of fast earthward flows detected on mid-tail probe THEMIS-C. Subsequently, magnetic dipolarizations and strong ECH wave intensifications were observed on THEMIS-D/E probes at L∼11 in the equatorial plasma sheet. Concurrently, Ground optical instruments detected diffuse auroral intensifications in the region surrounding the ionospheric footprints of the THEMIS probes. Together with the theoretical simulation performed by Ni et al. (2011e), we establish a causal conjunction between the ECH waves and diffuse auroras for the reported event. We also propose that the ECH wave and diffuse auroral intensification were likely triggered by the fast flow activity from the mid-tail and its resulting magnetic dipolarization. We discuss possible mechanisms linking the fast flow and its associated dipolarization to the intensification of ECH wave and diffuse aurora in the outer magnetosphere.

   abstract = {Ground-based auroral observations with a meridian-scanning photometer and all-sky camera were made at Rabbit Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, simultaneously with nearby HILAT satellite passes during six winter periods near new moon from 1984 to 1986. Eight passes were selected in which HILAT overflew auroras visible from Rabbit Lake. Auroral intensity measurements made at Rabbit Lake were corrected for proton aurora and nightglow and compared with HILAT electron flux measurements at 800 km. The excitation efficiency for the 4278-Å auroral emission by electron precipitation was found to be (0.29±0.08) kR/(erg/cm² s). Excitation efficiencies for 5577-Å emission of (1.73±0.51) kR/(erg/cm² s) and (1.23±0.44) kR/(erg/cm² s) were measured on different days in auroras excited by 1.8-keV and 3.1-keV Maxwellian precipitation during moderate geomagnetic disturbance. After small night-to-night variations in atmospheric composition indicated by the MSIS-86 model atmosphere were accounted for, the magnetic zenith column intensity ratio 6300/4278 was found to depend on the electron characteristic energy Eo approximately as 6300/4278 ∼ 3.3 Eo−2.1 for characteristic energies of a few keV. The 5577/4278 ratio was found to decrease by about 40% from 1 to 5 keV characteristic energy. These Results pertain mostly to weak auroras (I(5577 Å) = 2–6 kR). Most of these new measurements agree fairly well with previous results of other workers, but the two 5577-Å excitation efficiencies and the decreasing 5577/4278 intensity ratio show that the green line excitation efficiency varies appreciably even for small changes in the precipitating electron spectrum and atmospheric composition. Published calculations of the auroral 6300/4278 and 5577/4278 ratios versus characteristic energy are compared with our measurements. The magnitude and variation of the 5577/4278 ratios are consistent with roughly 60% of green line emission resulting from O(¹S) excitation by N2(A) energy transfer.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The coordinated RBSP-ECT particle measurements, analyzed in combination with fields and waves observations and state-of-the-art theory and modeling, are necessary for understanding the acceleration, global distribution, and variability of radiation belt electrons and ions, key science objectives of NASA’s Living With a Star program and the Van Allen Probes mission. The RBSP-ECT suite consists of three highly-coordinated instruments: the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) sensor, and the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT). Collectively they cover, continuously, the full electron and ion spectra from one eV to 10’s of MeV with sufficient energy resolution, pitch angle coverage and resolution, and with composition measurements in the critical energy range up to 50 keV and also from a few to 50 MeV/nucleon. All three instruments are based on measurement techniques proven in the radiation belts. The instruments use those proven techniques along with innovative new designs, optimized for operation in the most extreme conditions in order to provide unambiguous separation of ions and electrons and clean energy responses even in the presence of extreme penetrating background environments. The design, fabrication and operation of ECT spaceflight instrumentation in the harsh radiation belt environment ensure that particle measurements have the fidelity needed for closure in answering key mission science questions. ECT instrument details are provided in companion papers in this same issue.},

   abstract = {The Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)-Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma (ECT) suite contains an innovative complement of particle instruments to ensure the highest quality measurements ever made in the inner magnetosphere and radiation belts. The coordinated RBSP-ECT particle measurements, analyzed in combination with fields and waves observations and state-of-the-art theory and modeling, are necessary for understanding the acceleration, global distribution, and variability of radiation belt electrons and ions, key science objectives of NASA’s Living With a Star program and the Van Allen Probes mission. The RBSP-ECT suite consists of three highly-coordinated instruments: the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) sensor, and the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT). Collectively they cover, continuously, the full electron and ion spectra from one eV to 10’s of MeV with sufficient energy resolution, pitch angle coverage and resolution, and with composition measurements in the critical energy range up to 50 keV and also from a few to 50 MeV/nucleon. All three instruments are based on measurement techniques proven in the radiation belts. The instruments use those proven techniques along with innovative new designs, optimized for operation in the most extreme conditions in order to provide unambiguous separation of ions and electrons and clean energy responses even in the presence of extreme penetrating background environments. The design, fabrication and operation of ECT spaceflight instrumentation in the harsh radiation belt environment ensure that particle measurements have the fidelity needed for closure in answering key mission science questions. ECT instrument details are provided in companion papers in this same issue.},

   abstract = {Data from a long-duration balloon flight at 35-km height over the auroral zone during August 1959 showed that only very small fluxes of energetic X rays accompany visible auroras at this latitude. The maximum observed photon flux above 25 kev during a bright aurora was 2.5 cm?2 sec?1. Much larger fluxes, up to 40 cm?2 sec?1, preceded two active visible displays by about half an hour. On August 17 and 18 X-ray influxes were observed for several hours during the daytime. From Explorer VI data these are believed to be associated with the filling-up of the outer radiation belt after a geomagnetic storm. The scintillation counter employed permitted a determination of the X-ray energy spectrum at 6 g cm?2 depth from 25 to 300 kev on this and several other flights. From an analysis given here the parent electron spectrum is derived and found to be extremely steep. Typically, the ratio of the differential photon intensity at 30 kev to that at 160 kev is 350 to 1. Other balloon flights during August 1959 show that a large loss of electrons having energy >25 kev is occurring even on magnetically rather quiet days.},

   abstract = {The Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has yielded solar flare hard X-ray spectra with unprecedented resolution, enabling reconstruction of mean source electron energy spectra F̄(E) by deconvolution of photon energy spectra I(ε). While various algorithms have been proposed, the strengths and weaknesses of each have yet to be explored in a systematic fashion. For real data F̄(E) is unknown, so these various algorithms must instead be tested on simulated data for which the "true" F̄(E) is known. Accordingly, we devised several forms of F̄(E) with "interesting" features, generated the corresponding (noise-added) I(ε), and recovered F̄(E) using a variety of algorithms, including zero- and first-order Tikhonov regularizations, triangular matrix row elimination, and forward fitting using a parametric form consisting of a double power law with low/high cutoffs plus an isothermal component. All inversion methods reconstructed the general magnitude and form of F̄(E) well, suffering only from (1) blurring of sharp features and (2) poor recovery at low electron energies E in cases in which F̄′(E) was positive and large. Addition of a steep thermal component at low E did not prevent recovery of features at higher values of E. Forward fitting did recover large-scale forms and features well but, inevitably, failed to recover local features not expressible within the parametric used. This confirms that inversions are the most dependable way to discover such features. However, examination of the pattern of I(ε) residuals can suggest feature locations and so help refine the parametric form used. Since quite smooth F̄(E) forms do reproduce the observed I(ε) form with relatively small residuals, it appears that sharp features may be uncommon in actual flares. © 2006, The American Astronomical Society.

   abstract = {We present the first quantitative comparison of precipitating and geomagnetically trapped electron flux during a relativistic electron depletion event. Intense bremsstrahlung X-ray emission from relativistic electron precipitation was observed on January 19-20, 2000 (21:20-00:45 UT) by the germanium spectrometer on the MAXIS balloon payload (-7.2 to -9.3 E, 74 S corresponding to IGRF L = 4.7, 1920-2240 MLT). A rapid decrease in the geosynchronous >2 MeV electron flux was simultaneously observed at GOES-8 and GOES-10, and between 0.34-3.6 MeV by GPS ns33 at L = 4.7. The observations show that electrons were lost to the atmosphere early in the flux depletion event, during a period of magnetic field stretching in the tail. The observed X-ray spectrum is well modeled by an exponential distribution of precipitating electrons with an e-folding energy of 290 keV and a lower-energy cut-off of 400 keV. The duration of the event implies precipitation extended over at least 3 hours of MLT, assuming a source fixed in local time. Comparison of the precipitation rate with the flux decrease measured at GPS implies that the loss cone flux was only ∼1% of the equatorial flux. However, precipitation is sufficient to account for the rate of flux decrease if it extended over 2-3 hours of local time. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {Simultaneous balloon observations of auroral N2+ (?3914) emission and bremsstrahlung X rays produced by the precipitation of energetic electrons in the auroral zone suggest that two distinct groups of electrons are responsible for the observed effects. One group is responsible for the major portion of the total precipitated energy during visible aurora, and at times this group not only provides the dominant flux of X rays below about 40 kev but also accounts for most of the cosmic noise absorption. A remarkable feature of this group is the extent to which its average energy may vary, i.e., from several kev to greater than 25 kev during the post-midnight hours. A second group of particles is responsible for the X ray flux above 50 kev; however, the total power deposited in the atmosphere by this group is seldom greater than a few tenths erg cm?2 sec?1. The spectrum of these electrons can be represented by a simple exponential function with an e folding energy usually between 40 and 65 kev. A recognition of these features of the spectrum leads to a better understanding of the relationship between optical, X-ray, and auroral absorption events.},

Distinguishing spectral characteristics and variability, represented by approximate e-folding energies in the range 10?50 kev, are emphasized. Whereas the harder spectrums (E0 ≈ 25?50 kev) may be precipitated at any local hour, the softer spectrums (E0 ≈ 10?25 kev) appear primarily between the midnight and noon meridians. The softest spectrums (E0 ≈ 10?15 kev) observed in this energy range occur preferentially around midnight and into the early morning in association with pronounced negative magnetic bays and post-breakup auroral activity. The results suggest the existence of an intermediate spectrum (E0 ≈ 10?20 kev), in addition to the very soft (E0 ? 5 kev) precipitation characteristic of the luminous aurora and the rather harder precipitation (E0 ? 25 kev) characteristic of the ?average? auroral-zone X-ray event.},

   abstract = {We analyze a possibility of turning off post-smoothing (relaxation) in geometric multigrid when used as a preconditioner in preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) linear and eigenvalue solvers for the 3D Laplacian. The geometric Semicoarsening Multigrid (SMG) method is provided by the hypre parallel software package. We solve linear systems using two variants (standard and flexible) of PCG and preconditioned steepest descent (PSD) methods. The eigen-value problems are solved using the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method available in hypre through BLOPEX software. We observe that turning off the post-smoothing in SMG dramatically slows down the standard PCG-SMG. For flexible PCG and LOBPCG, our numerical tests show that removing the post-smoothing results in overall 40–50 percent acceleration, due to the high costs of smoothing and relatively insignificant decrease in convergence speed. We demonstrate that PSD-SMG and flexible PCG-SMG converge similarly if SMG post-smoothing is off. A theoretical justification is provided.},

Furthermore, a numerical algorithm which works well on the latter may be largely inefficient on the former. In the present analysis the numerical performances on a CRAY X-MP/48 of some widely known preconditioning techniques are compared, including the diagonal scaling, the incomplete Cholesky decomposition and the least squares polynomial preconditioners. The last ones, which are not suited to scalar machines, appear to be particularly attractive from a conceptual view point on vector/parallel architectures. The results obtained with 12 arbitrarily sparse finite element problems of growing size up to almost 5000, shows surprisingly that simple diagonal scaling is the most efficient preconditioning scheme in the majority of applications. In the few cases where it is not so, its performance is nevertheless comparable with that of the incomplete Cholesky factorization. Contrary to the general expectation, the polynomials exhibit a poor performance which does not increase with the degree and appear never to be competitive with the other two more traditional preconditioners.},

New results are derived for the cases where two common, noninduced matrix norms are used, and where different vector norms are used for the domain and range of the matrix. Condition numbers that respect the structure of symmetric problems are also analyzed. The sensitivity of the condition number itself is then investigated, and we obtain sharp examples of Demmel's general result that for certain problems in numerical analysis "the condition number of the condition number is the condition number." Finally, upper bounds are derived for the sensitivity of componentwise condition numbers. © 1995.},

   abstract = {With the advent of the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO), a complement of multi-spacecraft missions and ground-based observatories to study the space environment, data retrieval, analysis, and visualization of space physics data can be daunting. The Space Physics Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), a grass-roots software development platform (www.spedas.org), is now officially supported by NASA Heliophysics as part of its data environment infrastructure. It serves more than a dozen space missions and ground observatories and can integrate the full complement of past and upcoming space physics missions with minimal resources, following clear, simple, and well-proven guidelines. Free, modular and configurable to the needs of individual missions, it works in both command-line (ideal for experienced users) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode (reducing the learning curve for first-time users). Both options have “crib-sheets,” user-command sequences in ASCII format that can facilitate record-and-repeat actions, especially for complex operations and plotting. Crib-sheets enhance scientific interactions, as users can move rapidly and accurately from exchanges of technical information on data processing to efficient discussions regarding data interpretation and science. SPEDAS can readily query and ingest all International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP)-compatible products from the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF), enabling access to a vast collection of historic and current mission data. The planned incorporation of Heliophysics Application Programmer’s Interface (HAPI) standards will facilitate data ingestion from distributed datasets that adhere to these standards. Although SPEDAS is currently Interactive Data Language (IDL)-based (and interfaces to Java-based tools such as Autoplot), efforts are under-way to expand it further to work with python (first as an interface tool and potentially even receiving an under-the-hood replacement). We review the SPEDAS development history, goals, and current implementation. We explain its “modes of use” with examples geared for users and outline its technical implementation and requirements with software developers in mind. We also describe SPEDAS personnel and software management, interfaces with other organizations, resources and support structure available to the community, and future development plans.},

   abstract = {The radiation belts and plasma in the Earth’s magnetosphere pose hazards to satellite systems which restrict design and orbit options with a resultant impact on mission performance and cost. For decades the standard space environment specification used for spacecraft design has been provided by the NASA AE8 and AP8 trapped radiation belt models. There are well-known limitations on their performance, however, and the need for a new trapped radiation and plasma model has been recognized by the engineering community for some time. To address this challenge a new set of models, denoted AE9/AP9/SPM, for energetic electrons, energetic protons and space plasma has been developed. The new models offer significant improvements including more detailed spatial resolution and the quantification of uncertainty due to both space weather and instrument errors. Fundamental to the model design, construction and operation are a number of new data sets and a novel statistical approach which captures first order temporal and spatial correlations allowing for the Monte-Carlo estimation of flux thresholds for user-specified percentile levels (e.g., 50th and 95th) over the course of the mission. An overview of the model architecture, data reduction methods, statistics algorithms, user application and initial validation is presented in this paper.},

   abstract = {Electron flux in the Earth’s outer radiation belt is highly variable due to a delicate balance between competing acceleration and loss processes. It has been long recognized that Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves may play a crucial role in the loss of radiation belt electrons. Previous theoretical studies proposed that EMIC waves may account for the loss of the relativistic electron population. However, recent observations showed that while EMIC waves are responsible for the significant loss of ultra-relativistic electrons, the relativistic electron population is almost unaffected. In this study, we provide a theoretical explanation for this discrepancy between previous theoretical studies and recent observations. We demonstrate that EMIC waves mainly contribute to the loss of ultra-relativistic electrons. This study significantly improves the current understanding of the electron dynamics in the Earth’s radiation belt and also can help us understand the radiation environments of the exoplanets and outer planets.},

   abstract = {Whistler mode noise leads to electron pitch angle diffusion. Similarly, ion cyclotron noise couples to ions. This diffusion results in particle precipitation into the ionosphere and creates a pitch angle distributon of trapped particles that is unstable to further wave growth. Since excessive wave growth leads to rapid diffusion and particle loss, the requirement that the growth rate be limited to the rate at which wave energy is depleted by wave propagation permits an estimate of an upper limit to the trapped equatorial particle flux. Electron fluxes >40 kev and proton fluxes >120 kev observed on Explorers 14 and 12, respectively, obey this limit with occasional exceptions. Beyond L = 4, the fluxes are just below their limit, indicating that an unspecified acceleration source, sufficient to keep the trapped particles near their precipitation limit, exists. Limiting proton and electron fluxes are roughly equal, suggesting a partial explanation for the existence of larger densities of high-energy protons than of electrons. Observed electron pitch angle profiles correspond to a diffusion coefficient in agreement with observed lifetimes. The required equatorial whistler mode wide band noise intensity, 10?2?, is not obviously inconsistent with observations and is consistent with the lifetime and with limiting trapped particle intensity.},

Enhanced levels of electromagnetic ULF and ELF turbulence have recently been reported in association with detached regions of high density plasma in the outer magnetosphere. This is consistent with unstable cyclotron resonant generation which occurs most favourably at plasma densities higher than normally existant outside the plasmapause. The observed amplitude of ULF turbulence is sufficient to induce parasitic pitch-angle scattering of relativistic electrons at the strong diffusion limit. Such electrons should thus precipitate with an isotropic pitch-angle distribution and for 5 ≲ L ≲ 7 could produce sufficient D-region ionization below 70 km to account for the anomalous dayside attenuation of forward scatter signals reported by Bailey. In association with such REP events one should also observe intense precipitation of less energetic electrons and protons. Similar precipitation events should occur at night preceding the dayside REP by up to 1 hr.},

   abstract = {Abstra&-Two events in August 1967, categorized as relativistic electron precipitation (REP) events by their effeot on VHF transmissions propagated via the forward-scatter mode, have been examined with regard to the energy spectra of trapped and precipitated electrons, These two substorm-associated events (11 August and 25 August) differ with respect to the relativistic, trapped electron population at synchronous altitude; in the 25 August event there was a non-adiabatic enhancement of relativistic (>400 keV) electrons while in the 11 August event no relativistic electrons were produced. In both events electron spectra deduced from bremss-trahlung measurements (made on a field line close to that of the satellite) had approximately the same e-folding energies as the trapped eleotron enhancements. However, the spectrum of electrons in the 25 August event (Es = 100-150 keV) was significantly harder than the spectrum in the event of 11 August (Es = 40-70 keV). The spectrum of precipitated electrons deduced from the ratio of VHF forward-scatter absorption to riometer absorption can be made consistent with the spectrum deduced from the bremsstrahlung measurements if the normal summer daytime scattering height for VHF propagation is assumed to lie between 70 and 75 km. However, in the absence of an independent determination of the scattering height, the spectrum of the precipitating electrons can not be deduced from these VHF measurements alone.},

The effects of wave propagation obliquely to the geomagnetic field direction with the resulting diffusion at all cyclotron-harmonic resonances and the Landau resonance are evaluated along with the effects of interactions occurring at all geomagnetic latitudes.

   abstract = {An investigation has been made of processes responsible for the growth, damping, and propagation characteristics of whistler mode emissions within the earth's plasmasphere. Three-dimensional ray path calculations of the integrated wave gain in a realistic model plasmasphere have provided an explicit confirmation of the anisotropic electron cyclotron resonant generation mechanism for the maintenance of plasmaspheric hiss. Peak wave amplification occurs for field-aligned waves in the outer plasmasphere. The majority of unstable low-frequency waves follow ray trajectories that internally reflect at the plasmapause and are thus trapped within the plasmasphere. This reflection allows waves to subsequently propagate into the locally stable inner and middle plasmasphere and also migrate substantially in longitude. The combination of internal reflection at the plasmapause and magnetospheric reflection at high latitude provide an important class of wave trajectories that are recycled back to the equatorial growth region with sufficiently small wave normal angles to allow further cyclotron resonant amplification. It is unlikely that wave growth can occur from the natural incoherent emissivity level within the plasmasphere since the required gains (≈100 dB) would mandate unreasonably high energetic electron flux. An alternate, as yet unidentified, embryonic source is therefore required to initiate the growth process. But once established the observed spectrum of broad band plasmaspheric hiss can be maintained by the modest net gains anticipated along ray trajectories that are recycled back to the favorable equatorial growth region. A simulation of the spectral properties of waves arriving at selected observation points following several equatorial transits shows that the largest accumulated gain occurs for recycled waves that reflect from the plasmapause following each equatorial crossing. Furthermore, the peak gain is relatively insensitive to the location of the observation point, and waves are expected to arrive over a broad solid angle in k space consistant with observations. The ability of waves to gain access to regions far from the source is a direct result of the relatively weaker Landau damping of oblique waves along the high latitude portion of the recycled ray path in comparison to the equatorial cyclotron resonant growth. The hiss upper frequency cutoff can result from the limited anisotropy of the cyclotron resonant electrons, the more severe Landau damping at higher frequencies, or in part, from the decreased ability of the higher frequency waves to recycle and thus experience multitransit growth. The characteristic lower frequency cutoff can be due to either the decrease in flux of energetic electrons that cyclotron resonate with the lower frequency waves or from thermal electron Landau damping should the plasmaspheric electron temperature exceed several electron volts.},

   abstract = {The presence of a turbulent band of ELF hiss throughout the plasmasphere has been modeled by following unducted whistler mode waves from a restricted region of cyclotron resonant growth in the outer plasmasphere. The most unstable waves originate near the equatorial plane within a modest cone of wave normal angles aligned along the ambient magnetic field. As the waves propagate to higher latitude, their wave normal direction becomes progressively oblique, and ray paths generally migrate outward until they reach the plasmapause. A major fraction of the incident waves internally reflect at the steep plasmapause density gradient and subsequently propagate inward to populate most of the plasmasphere. Only a minor part of the wave energy is able to escape from the plasmasphere, primarily at high latitude. A detailed study of the internally trapped ray paths shows that certain waves can return to the equatorial growth region with field-aligned propagation vectors and thus experience further amplification. this is particularly important for the maintenance of quiet time hiss when a single transit of the growth region is insufficient to amplify the background incoherent cyclotron noise to detectable levels. The model calculations demonstrate that the observed frequency spectrum and polarization of plasmaspheric hiss not only are controlled by the relative rates of cyclotron gowth and Landau damping but also are strongly influenced by the wave propagation characteristics.},

We use geomagnetic activity dependent templates to separate plasmaspheric hiss from chorus. In the region 22?14 magnetic local time (MLT) the boundary between plasmaspheric hiss and chorus moves to lower values with increasing geomagnetic activity. The average wave intensity of plasmaspheric hiss is largest on the dayside and increases with increasing geomagnetic activity from midnight through dawn to dusk. Plasmaspheric hiss is most intense and spatially extended in the 200 to 500 Hz frequency band during active conditions, 400  750 nT, with an average intensity of 1,128 pT in the region 05?17 MLT from 1.5 . In the prenoon sector, waves in the 100 to 200 Hz frequency band peak near the magnetic equator and decrease in intensity with increasing magnetic latitude, inconsistent with a source from chorus outside the plasmapause, but more consistent with local amplification by substorm-injected electrons. At higher frequencies the average wave intensities in this sector exhibit two peaks, one near the magnetic equator and one at high latitudes, 45° °, with a minimum at intermediate latitudes, 30° °, consistent with a source from chorus outside the plasmapause. In the premidnight sector, the intensity of plasmaspheric hiss in the frequency range 50 < f < 1,000 Hz decreases with increasing geomagnetic activity. The source of this weak premidnight plasmaspheric hiss is likely to be chorus at larger in the postnoon sector that enters that plasmasphere in the postnoon sector and subsequently propagates eastward in MLT.},

Using newly available Van Allen Probes wave data, which provide excellent coverage in the entire inner magnetosphere, we evaluate the global distribution of the hiss wave frequency spectrum and wave intensity for different levels of substorm activity. Our statistical results show that observed hiss peak frequencies are generally lower than the commonly adopted value (~550?Hz), which was in frequent use, and that the hiss wave power frequently extends below 100?Hz, particularly at larger L shells (>?~3) on the dayside during enhanced levels of substorm activity. We also compare electron pitch angle scattering rates caused by hiss using the new statistical frequency spectrum and the previously adopted Gaussian spectrum and find that the differences are up to a factor of ~5 and are dependent on energy and L shell. Moreover, the new statistical hiss wave frequency spectrum including wave power below 100?Hz leads to increased pitch angle scattering rates by a factor of ~1.5 for electrons above ~100?keV at L~5, although their effect is negligible at L?≤?3. Consequently, we suggest that the new realistic hiss wave frequency spectrum should be incorporated into future modeling of radiation belt electron dynamics.},

For radiation belt electrons, non-adiabatic behavior is primarily associated with energy and momentum transfer during interactions with various magnetospheric waves. A review is presented here of recent advances in both our understanding and global modeling of such wave-particle interactions, which have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of electron acceleration in the radiation belts; internal local acceleration, rather than radial diffusion now appears to be the dominant acceleration process during the recovery phase of magnetic storms.},

This hiss is a dominant factor in controlling the two-zone structure of the Van Allen radiation belts, and since it removes high-energy electrons from the plasmasphere, it plays a pivotal role in reducing the radiation hazards to satellites and humans in space. Many theories have been proposed to explain the origin of the hiss, but none have stood the test of time. Bortnik et al. have used data from the CRRES satellite to develop a new model that explains hiss as a derivative of another wave type called chorus. Previously thought to be unrelated to hiss, chorus can propagate into the plasmasphere and subsequently evolve into hiss.},

   abstract = {The rapid loss of radiation belt electrons in the main phase of geomagnetic storms is believed to be aided by EMIC waves, and is usually analyzed with quasi-linear theory. However, even moderate EMIC wave intensities easily cause resonant electrons to respond nonlinearly, with drastically different results. We map out the region of nonlinear behavior with a single parameter, and show that both the direction and magnitude of scattering can be estimated by analytical expressions. The nonlinear interactions typically lead to advection toward large pitch angles, rather than diffusion toward the loss cone. This is expected to reduce the overall loss rate and greatly affect the distribution of trapped electrons.},

Chorus was detected in conjunction with magnetospheric substorms throughout the region from L = 5 to L = 9 but only during postmidnight hours. No chorus was seen in the 3 hr preceding midnight even when substorms were in progress. The postmidnight chorus occurred only within ±15° of, and most frequently at, the geomagnetic equator. Time-averaged intensities varied from 10?8 to 10?6 ?²/Hz, which is more than an order below the maximum values reported previously for dayside chorus. The chorus occurred in narrow frequency bands having a bandwidth of 50?200 Hz. Chorus frequencies varied from less than one-fourth to as high as three-fourths of the equatorial electron gyrofrequency as determined by the on-board magnetometer. All frequencies in this range were detected except for a narrow band near one-half the electron gyrofrequency where the chorus appeared to be strongly attenuated. Chorus was often observed as two distinct bands above and below one-half the gyrofrequency. The two most common types of chorus were narrow band chorus without structure and falling tones. Rising tones and hooks were also observed. Chorus pulsations were observed often with quasi-periods of 5?15 s. A correlation was sought, but none was found, between the micropulsations in the ambient magnetic field and the chorus pulsations. Many features of postmidnight chorus can be explained by a cyclotron resonant interaction between the waves and the substorm electrons. The distribution of the chorus as a function of local time and L is strikingly similar to the distribution of enhanced, trapped, and precipitated substorm electrons with energies >40 keV. The postmidnight occurrence of chorus is attributable to the eastward curvature and gradient drift of the injected electrons. Cyclotron resonant interactions should be strongest near the equator, as was observed. The confinement to within 15° of the equator is attributed to Landau damping by low-energy (1?10 keV) auroral electrons. The attenuation band at one-half the electron gyrofrequency may result from Landau damping by electrons that have energy corresponding to cyclotron resonance but are traveling in the same direction as the waves. A close correspondence is expected between the occurrence of postmidnight and dayside chorus. The maximum in dayside chorus intensity at approximately 1000 LT, which is correlated with the dayside maximum of energetic electron precipitation, may represent further precipitation of the substorm electrons injected near midnight.},

Compared to the lower-band chorus, a relatively higher electron anisotropy is required to generate upper-band chorus.

   abstract = {Energetic electrons in the outer radiation belt can resonate with intense bursts of whistler-mode chorus emission leading to microburst precipitation into the atmosphere. The timescale for removal of outer zone MeV electrons during the main phase of the October 1998 magnetic storm has been computed by comparing the rate of microburst loss observed on SAMPEX with trapped flux levels observed on Polar. Effective lifetimes are comparable to a day and are relatively independent of L shell. The lifetimes have also been evaluated by theoretical calculations based on quasi-linear scattering by field-aligned waves. Agreement with the observations requires average wide-band wave amplitudes comparable to 100 pT, which is consistent with the intensity of chorus emissions observed under active conditions. MeV electron scattering is most efficient during first-order cyclotron resonance with chorus emissions at geomagnetic latitudes above 30 degrees. Consequently, the zone of MeV microbursts tends to maximize in the prenoon (0400?1200 MLT) sector, since nightside chorus is more strongly confined to the equator.},

These waves are an order of magnitude larger than previously observed for whistlers in the radiation belt. Although the peak frequency is similar to whistler chorus, there are distinct differences from chorus, in addition to the larger amplitudes, including the lack of drift in frequency and the oblique propagation with a large longitudinal electric field component. Simulations show that these large amplitude waves can energize an electron by the order of an MeV in less than 0.1s, explaining the rapid enhancement in electron intensities observed between the STEREO-B and STEREO-A passage during this event. Our results show that the usual theoretical models of electron energization and scattering via small-amplitude waves, with timescales of hours to days, may be inadequate for understanding radiation belt dynamics.},

Specific wave events in the 1300?0100 MLT local time sector and over L = 4.8 ? 6.7 at magnetic latitudes between ± 20° have been studied with respect to energy propagation. Using the wave magnetic field data and the orthogonal two-component Berkeley electric field experiment data allows the computation of the Poynting vector. Nine events with frequencies below 0.6 Hz have been analyzed. General wave properties showed intensities in the range 4?18 ?W m?2. In most events, energy propagation was predominantly away from the equator, supporting the existence of an equatorial source region. There are exceptions and one event, observed 3° from the equator, also showed some propagation back to the equator with equal energy. Four periodic wave packets were seen in another event. This event showed unidirectional propagation away from the equator over all packets with periodicity approximately one-half of the calculated time for a typical bouncing wave packet. Consequently, the periodicity is not the signature of a classical periodic structured Pc 1?2 pulsation event of the type seen on the ground. Generally, the results for these waves with f < fHe+ may be interpreted by assuming an ion cyclotron instability source located near the equator and irregularly emitting wave trains of energy into one or both hemispheres, with minimal reflection at the ionosphere.},

CRRES covered the region L = 3.5?8.0, magnetic latitude up to ±30°, and magnetic local time 1400?0800. From 6464 hours of observation a total of 248 EMIC wave events were identified. For the first time the Poynting vector for Pc 1 EMIC waves is presented in the dynamic spectral domain permitting the study of energy propagation of simultaneous waves located in different frequency bands. The maximum wave energy flux for the events was 25 ?W/m2, averaging range 1.3 ?W/m2, with the direction of wave energy propagation independent of wave frequency but dependent on magnetic latitude. EMIC wave energy propagation was bidirectional both away and toward the equator, for events observed below 11° ?MLat?. Unidirectional wave energy propagation away from the equator was observed for all events located above 11° ?MLat?. This supports the concept of unidirectional EMIC wave energy propagation away from a broad source region centered on the geomagnetic equator. No measurable energy was observed propagating equatorward beyond the source region, in contradiction to the BWP paradigm.},

This storm was caused partly by Bz< 0 fields in the sheath region behind an interplanetary shock and partly by the magnetic cloud driving the shock. The storm was characterized by a maximum Kp=7? and a minimum Dst=?115 nT and had a distinctive two-phase decay related to the passage of the ejection at the Earth. We model the ring current development caused by adiabatic drifts and losses due to charge exchange, Coulomb collisions, wave-particle interactions, and atmospheric collisions at low altitudes. The nightside magnetospheric inflow is simulated using geosynchronous Los Alamos National Laboratory data, whereas the dayside free outflow corresponds to losses through the dayside magnetopause. We calculate the equatorial growth rate of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves with frequencies between the oxygen and helium gyrofrequencies and their integrated wave gain as the storm progresses. The regions of maximum wave amplification compare reasonably well to satellite observations. A time-dependent global wave model is constructed, and the spatial and temporal evolution of precipitating proton fluxes during different storm phases is determined. We find that the global patterns of proton precipitation are very dynamic: located at larger L shells during prestorm conditions, moving to lower L shells as geomagnetic activity increases during storm main phase, and receding back toward larger L shells with storm recovery. However, the most intense fluxes are observed along the duskside plasmapause during the main and early recovery phase of the storm and are caused by plasma wave scattering. This study is relevant to the analysis of the anticipated new data sets from the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) and Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) missions.},

   abstract = {Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves which propagate at frequencies below the proton gyrofrequency can undergo cyclotron resonant interactions with relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt and cause pitch-angle scattering and electron loss to the atmosphere. Typical storm-time wave amplitudes of 1?10 nT cause strong diffusion scattering which may lead to significant relativistic electron loss at energies above the minimum energy for resonance, Emin. A statistical analysis of over 800 EMIC wave events observed on the CRRES spacecraft is performed to establish whether scattering can occur at geophysically interesting energies (≤2 MeV). While Emin is well above 2 MeV for the majority of these events, it can fall below 2 MeV in localized regions of high plasma density and/or low magnetic field (fpe/fce,eq > 10) for wave frequencies just below the hydrogen or helium ion gyrofrequencies. These lower energy scattering events, which are mainly associated with resonant L-mode waves, are found within the magnetic local time range 1300 < MLT < 1800 for L > 4.5. The average wave spectral intensity of these events (4?5 nT2/Hz) is sufficient to cause strong diffusion scattering. The spatial confinement of these events, together with the limited set of these waves that resonate with ≤2 MeV electrons, suggest that these electrons are only subject to strong scattering over a small fraction of their drift orbit. Consequently, drift-averaged scattering lifetimes are expected to lie in the range of several hours to a day. EMIC wave scattering should therefore significantly affect relativistic electron dynamics during a storm. The waves that resonate with the ?MeV electrons are produced by low-energy (?keV) ring current protons, which are expected to be injected into the inner magnetosphere during enhanced convection events.},

The burst occurred at 1532?1554 UT on August 20, 1996, and consisted of seven peaks of ?60?90 s duration, spaced by ?100?200 s, with quasi-periodic (?10?20 s) modulation of the peak count rates. The very hard X-ray spectrum extends to the instrumental limit of 1.4 MeV, and is consistent with bremsstrahlung emission from monoenergetic, ?1.7 MeV, precipitating electrons. Since the trapped relativistic electrons showed a steeply falling energy spectrum from 0.6 to 4 MeV (at L=6.6), the precipitation mechanism appears to be highly energy selective. The modulation frequencies suggest scattering of the MeV electrons due to gyro-resonance with Doppler-shifted electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, but either equatorial proton densities a factor of ?10² higher than typical for the plasmasphere or significant O+ densities would be required.},

   abstract = {On August 20, 1996, balloon-borne X-ray detectors observed an intense X-ray event as part of a French balloon campaign near Kiruna, Sweden, at 1532 UT (1835 magnetic local time), on an L shell of 5.8. The energy spectrum of this event shows the presence of X rays with energies > 1 MeV, which are best accounted for by atmospheric bremsstrahlung from monoenergetic ∼1.7 MeV precipitating electrons. Ultraviolet images from the Polar satellite and energetic particle data from the Los Alamos geosynchronous satellites show the onset of a small magnetospheric substorm 24 min before the start of the relativistic electron precipitation event. Since the balloon was south of the auroral oval and there was no associated increase in relativistic electron flux at geosynchronous altitude, the event is interpreted as the result of selective precipitation of ambient relativistic electrons from the radiation belts. Pitch angle scattering caused by resonance with electromagnetic ion cyclotron mode waves is the most likely mechanism for selective precipitation of MeV electrons. A model is presented in which wave growth is driven by temperature anisotropies in the drifting substorm-injected proton population. The model predicts that this wave growth and resonance with ∼1.7 MeV electrons will occur preferentially in regions of density >10 cm-3, such as inside the duskside plasmapause bulge or detached plasma regions. The model predictions are consistent with the location of the balloon, the observed energies, and the timing with respect to the substorm energetic particle injection.

   abstract = {Auroral substorms, dynamic phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere at night, are caused by global reconfiguration of the magnetosphere, which releases stored solar wind energy. These storms are characterized by auroral brightening from dusk to midnight, followed by violent motions of distinct auroral arcs that suddenly break up, and the subsequent emergence of diffuse, pulsating auroral patches at dawn. Pulsating aurorae, which are quasiperiodic, blinking patches of light tens to hundreds of kilometres across, appear at altitudes of about 100 kilometres in the high-latitude regions of both hemispheres, and multiple patches often cover the entire sky. This auroral pulsation, with periods of several to tens of seconds, is generated by the intermittent precipitation of energetic electrons (several to tens of kiloelectronvolts) arriving from the magnetosphere and colliding with the atoms and molecules of the upper atmosphere. A possible cause of this precipitation is the interaction between magnetospheric electrons and electromagnetic waves called whistler-mode chorus waves. However, no direct observational evidence of this interaction has been obtained so far. Here we report that energetic electrons are scattered by chorus waves, resulting in their precipitation. Our observations were made in March 2017 with a magnetospheric spacecraft equipped with a high-angular-resolution electron sensor and electromagnetic field instruments. The measured quasiperiodic precipitating electron flux was sufficiently intense to generate a pulsating aurora, which was indeed simultaneously observed by a ground auroral imager.},
