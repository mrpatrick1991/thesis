abstract = {This is a preliminary report of results obtained concerning radiation intensities measured with a single geiger tube carried by the artificial earth satellites 1958 a and 1958 7.6 The counting rate of the counter in 1958 a was transmitted continuously, and the data were recorded only when the satellite was quite near one of the 16 receiving stations dis- tributed over the earth. The data collected by 1958 y were also telemetered con- tinuously. In addition, a small magnetic tape recorder stored the data obtained during each entire orbit. Then, as the satellite passed near one of the receiving stations, a radio command from the ground caused these data to be read out. A preliminary study of the data obtained from 1958 a and several interrogations of 1958 y has been carried out, with the following results},

abstract = {Ground-based auroral observations with a meridian-scanning photometer and all-sky camera were made at Rabbit Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, simultaneously with nearby HILAT satellite passes during six winter periods near new moon from 1984 to 1986. Eight passes were selected in which HILAT overflew auroras visible from Rabbit Lake. Auroral intensity measurements made at Rabbit Lake were corrected for proton aurora and nightglow and compared with HILAT electron flux measurements at 800 km. The excitation efficiency for the 4278-{\AA} auroral emission by electron precipitation was found to be (0.29±0.08) kR/(erg/cm² s). Excitation efficiencies for 5577-{\AA} emission of (1.73±0.51) kR/(erg/cm² s) and (1.23±0.44) kR/(erg/cm² s) were measured on different days in auroras excited by 1.8-keV and 3.1-keV Maxwellian precipitation during moderate geomagnetic disturbance. After small night-to-night variations in atmospheric composition indicated by the MSIS-86 model atmosphere were accounted for, the magnetic zenith column intensity ratio 6300/4278 was found to depend on the electron characteristic energy Eo approximately as 6300/4278 ∼ 3.3 Eo−2.1 for characteristic energies of a few keV. The 5577/4278 ratio was found to decrease by about 40% from 1 to 5 keV characteristic energy. These Results pertain mostly to weak auroras (I(5577 {\AA}) = 2–6 kR). Most of these new measurements agree fairly well with previous results of other workers, but the two 5577-{\AA} excitation efficiencies and the decreasing 5577/4278 intensity ratio show that the green line excitation efficiency varies appreciably even for small changes in the precipitating electron spectrum and atmospheric composition. Published calculations of the auroral 6300/4278 and 5577/4278 ratios versus characteristic energy are compared with our measurements. The magnitude and variation of the 5577/4278 ratios are consistent with roughly 60% of green line emission resulting from O(¹S) excitation by N2(A) energy transfer.},

abstract = {The subject of this book is stratospheric balloons used for scientific observations and for the development of space technology and balloons that are used for aerological observations. These balloons attain flight altitudes more than three times those of passenger planes. They transport payloads ranging from several hundred kilograms up to several tons into the earth's stratosphere. The density of the atmosphere at these altitudes is less than 1% that at the earth's surface. In addition, as part of planetary exploration, this book includes planetary balloons sent to float over other planets that have atmospheres, such as Mars and Venus. The general term used to describe these sorts of activities is scientific ballooning. Although the flights of stratospheric balloons used for various scientific observations and technological experiments do not take place in the void of space, stratospheric balloons may be placed in the same fields as rockets and satellites, namely space science and technology. This, of course, goes without saying for planetary balloons that are transported into outer space on space vehicles. Organizations that conduct research and development, and that launch and perform operations with this type of scientific ballooning are usually associated with each country's meteorological organizations and space research and development organizations. Stratospheric balloons are giant pressurized membrane structures that float in the thin atmosphere of the stratosphere. Their volumes range from a few tens of thousands of cubic meters up to several hundred thousand cubic meters. Their flight characteristics are governed by complex relationships of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. For planetary balloons, various atmospheric conditions that differ from those on the ground also come into effect. Consequently, performing systematic engineering design and analysis is a prerequisite for constructing and launching balloons. Aerological knowledge of the atmosphere is indispensable for conducting a flight. Such a foundation also ensures safety and reliability during flights. The aim of this book is to systematically describe the engineering aspects associated with scientific ballooning. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009. All rights reserved.},

Three angular distributions for the incident stream are considered: (1) a monodirectional beam, (2) a distribution varying as the cosine of the pitch angle, and (3) an isotropic distribution. The luminosity profiles for the N2+ 1 N.G. (0,0) band are predicted for various energy distributions of auroral primaries. Power laws and exponential laws with a range of exponents are investigated: the shape of the luminosity profile is highly sensitive to the energy distribution function adopted.

abstract = {The Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)-Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma (ECT) suite contains an innovative complement of particle instruments to ensure the highest quality measurements ever made in the inner magnetosphere and radiation belts. The coordinated RBSP-ECT particle measurements, analyzed in combination with fields and waves observations and state-of-the-art theory and modeling, are necessary for understanding the acceleration, global distribution, and variability of radiation belt electrons and ions, key science objectives of NASA's Living With a Star program and the Van Allen Probes mission. The RBSP-ECT suite consists of three highly-coordinated instruments: the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) sensor, and the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT). Collectively they cover, continuously, the full electron and ion spectra from one eV to 10's of MeV with sufficient energy resolution, pitch angle coverage and resolution, and with composition measurements in the critical energy range up to 50 keV and also from a few to 50 MeV/nucleon. All three instruments are based on measurement techniques proven in the radiation belts. The instruments use those proven techniques along with innovative new designs, optimized for operation in the most extreme conditions in order to provide unambiguous separation of ions and electrons and clean energy responses even in the presence of extreme penetrating background environments. The design, fabrication and operation of ECT spaceflight instrumentation in the harsh radiation belt environment ensure that particle measurements have the fidelity needed for closure in answering key mission science questions. ECT instrument details are provided in companion papers in this same issue.},

abstract = {The Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has yielded solar flare hard X-ray spectra with unprecedented resolution, enabling reconstruction of mean source electron energy spectra F̄(E) by deconvolution of photon energy spectra I($\epsilon$). While various algorithms have been proposed, the strengths and weaknesses of each have yet to be explored in a systematic fashion. For real data F̄(E) is unknown, so these various algorithms must instead be tested on simulated data for which the "true" F̄(E) is known. Accordingly, we devised several forms of F̄(E) with "interesting" features, generated the corresponding (noise-added) I($\epsilon$), and recovered F̄(E) using a variety of algorithms, including zero- and first-order Tikhonov regularizations, triangular matrix row elimination, and forward fitting using a parametric form consisting of a double power law with low/high cutoffs plus an isothermal component. All inversion methods reconstructed the general magnitude and form of F̄(E) well, suffering only from (1) blurring of sharp features and (2) poor recovery at low electron energies E in cases in which F̄′(E) was positive and large. Addition of a steep thermal component at low E did not prevent recovery of features at higher values of E. Forward fitting did recover large-scale forms and features well but, inevitably, failed to recover local features not expressible within the parametric used. This confirms that inversions are the most dependable way to discover such features. However, examination of the pattern of I($\epsilon$) residuals can suggest feature locations and so help refine the parametric form used. Since quite smooth F̄(E) forms do reproduce the observed I($\epsilon$) form with relatively small residuals, it appears that sharp features may be uncommon in actual flares. {\textcopyright} 2006, The American Astronomical Society.

The main idea is to consider the signal as a sum of two components: a piecewise constant component and a smooth component. For the solution of ill-posed problems, the Tikhonov method with a special stabilizer in the form of a sum of two different stabilizers is used: the total variation for the first component and the Sobolev norm for the second one. An iteratively re-weighted least squares technique is used as a fast and an efficient algorithm for minimization of the Tikhonov functional. A method is also presented for determining the regularization parameters. Numerical experiments, among the many performed, in denoising, deblurring, and compressed sensing demonstrate high performance of the new regularization for reconstruction of piecewise-smooth solutions with sharp discontinuities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present in this paper multi-instrumental observations and analyses of fast earthward flows, electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves, and diffuse auroras, during 8-9 UT on February 5, 2009. The event began with a series of fast earthward flows detected on mid-tail probe THEMIS-C. Subsequently, magnetic dipolarizations and strong ECH wave intensifications were observed on THEMIS-D/E probes at L∼11 in the equatorial plasma sheet. Concurrently, Ground optical instruments detected diffuse auroral intensifications in the region surrounding the ionospheric footprints of the THEMIS probes. Together with the theoretical simulation performed by Ni et al. (2011e), we establish a causal conjunction between the ECH waves and diffuse auroras for the reported event. We also propose that the ECH wave and diffuse auroral intensification were likely triggered by the fast flow activity from the mid-tail and its resulting magnetic dipolarization. We discuss possible mechanisms linking the fast flow and its associated dipolarization to the intensification of ECH wave and diffuse aurora in the outer magnetosphere.

abstract = {Determination of the fluxes and spectra of energetic particle precipitation into the Earth's atmosphere is of critical importance for radiation belt dynamics, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, as well as atmospheric chemistry. To improve the assessments of precipitating electrons using X-ray measurements requires deeper understanding of bremsstrahlung production, transport, and redistribution throughout the atmosphere. Here we use first-principles Monte Carlo models to explore relativistic electron precipitation events from the perspective of bremsstrahlung X-rays. The spatial distribution of X-rays is quantified from the ground level up to satellite altitudes. We then simulate X-ray images that would be captured using an ideal camera and calculate the energy spectra of X-rays originating from monoenergetic beams of precipitating electrons. Moreover, we show how these impulse responses to monoenergetic beams can be used to reconstruct the precipitating source using an inversion technique. Modeling results show that space-borne measurements of backscattered X-rays provide a promising method to estimate precipitation spatial size, fluxes, and spectra.},

abstract = {Space weather refers to the dynamic, highly variable conditions in the geospace environment including those on the sun, in the interplanetary medium, and in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. Adverse changes in the near-Earth space environment can diminish the performance and reliability of both spacecraft and ground-based systems. This, in turn, can spell major losses due to communication, navigation, power system, and reconnaissance satellite operational problems. This paper discusses some of the principal adverse space environmental effects presently known including trapped magnetospheric radiation, solar energetic particles, geomagnetic storms, and magnetospheric substorms. The scientific underpinnings for present prediction methods in space weather are considered. It is concluded that practical and effective methods of predicting and mitigating space weather effects are close at hand. {\textcopyright}1998 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The TPM, along with other hardware, can implement a cloaked computation, whose memory state cannot be observed by any other software, including the operating system and hypervisor. We show that malware can use cloaked computations to hide essential secrets (like the target of an attack) from a malware analyst. We describe and implement a protocol that establishes an encryption key under control of the TPM that can only be used by a specific infection program. An infected host then proves the legitimacy of this key to a remote malware distribution platform, and receives and executes an encrypted payload in a way that prevents software visibility of the decrypted payload. We detail how malware can benefit from cloaked computations and discuss defenses against our protocol. Hardening legitimate uses of the TPM against attack improves the resilience of our malware, creating a Catch-22 for secure computing technology.},

abstract = {We present the first quantitative comparison of precipitating and geomagnetically trapped electron flux during a relativistic electron depletion event. Intense bremsstrahlung X-ray emission from relativistic electron precipitation was observed on January 19-20, 2000 (21:20-00:45 UT) by the germanium spectrometer on the MAXIS balloon payload (-7.2 to -9.3 E, 74 S corresponding to IGRF L = 4.7, 1920-2240 MLT). A rapid decrease in the geosynchronous >2 MeV electron flux was simultaneously observed at GOES-8 and GOES-10, and between 0.34-3.6 MeV by GPS ns33 at L = 4.7. The observations show that electrons were lost to the atmosphere early in the flux depletion event, during a period of magnetic field stretching in the tail. The observed X-ray spectrum is well modeled by an exponential distribution of precipitating electrons with an e-folding energy of 290 keV and a lower-energy cut-off of 400 keV. The duration of the event implies precipitation extended over at least 3 hours of MLT, assuming a source fixed in local time. Comparison of the precipitation rate with the flux decrease measured at GPS implies that the loss cone flux was only ∼1% of the equatorial flux. However, precipitation is sufficient to account for the rate of flux decrease if it extended over 2-3 hours of local time. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Bremsstrahlung hard X-ray emission extending up to {\textasciitilde}300 keV, from the precipitation of high-energy electrons, was observed on six separate occasions over the auroral zone, all during low geomagnetic activity (Kp<=2+). All events were consistent with emission at the trapping boundary; observations over the polar cap showed no precipitation. We present the first high-resolution ($\Delta$E{\textasciitilde}2 keV/full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectra of this hard X-ray emission in the energy range 20-300 keV. The observed count spectra are deconvolved by model-independent techniques to photon spectra and then the precipitating electron spectra.

abstract = {Earth's diffuse aurora occurs over a broad latitude range and is primarily caused by the precipitation of low-energy (0.1-30-keV) electrons originating in the central plasma sheet, which is the source region for hot electrons in the nightside outer magnetosphere. Although generally not visible, the diffuse auroral precipitation provides the main source of energy for the high-latitude nightside upper atmosphere, leading to enhanced ionization and chemical changes. Previous theoretical studies have indicated that two distinct classes of magnetospheric plasma wave, electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves and whistler-mode chorus waves, could be responsible for the electron scattering that leads to diffuse auroral precipitation, but it has hitherto not been possible to determine which is the more important. Here we report an analysis of satellite wave data and Fokker-Planck diffusion calculations which reveals that scattering by chorus is the dominant cause of the most intense diffuse auroral precipitation. This resolves a long-standing controversy. Furthermore, scattering by chorus can remove most electrons as they drift around Earth's magnetosphere, leading to the development of observed pancake distributions, and can account for the global morphology of the diffuse aurora. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Auroral substorms, dynamic phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere at night, are caused by global reconfiguration of the magnetosphere, which releases stored solar wind energy. These storms are characterized by auroral brightening from dusk to midnight, followed by violent motions of distinct auroral arcs that suddenly break up, and the subsequent emergence of diffuse, pulsating auroral patches at dawn. Pulsating aurorae, which are quasiperiodic, blinking patches of light tens to hundreds of kilometres across, appear at altitudes of about 100 kilometres in the high-latitude regions of both hemispheres, and multiple patches often cover the entire sky. This auroral pulsation, with periods of several to tens of seconds, is generated by the intermittent precipitation of energetic electrons (several to tens of kiloelectronvolts) arriving from the magnetosphere and colliding with the atoms and molecules of the upper atmosphere. A possible cause of this precipitation is the interaction between magnetospheric electrons and electromagnetic waves called whistler-mode chorus waves. However, no direct observational evidence of this interaction has been obtained so far. Here we report that energetic electrons are scattered by chorus waves, resulting in their precipitation. Our observations were made in March 2017 with a magnetospheric spacecraft equipped with a high-angular-resolution electron sensor and electromagnetic field instruments. The measured quasiperiodic precipitating electron flux was sufficiently intense to generate a pulsating aurora, which was indeed simultaneously observed by a ground auroral imager.},

The new model and the associated NRLMSIS database now include the following data: (1) total mass density from satellite accelerometers and from orbit determination (including the Jacchia and Barlier data sets), (2) temperature from incoherent scatter radar covering 1981-1997, and (3) molecular oxygen number density, [O2], from solar ultraviolet occultation aboard the Solar Maximum Mission. A new component, "anomalous oxygen," allows for appreciable O+ and hot atomic oxygen contributions to the total mass density at high altitudes and applies primarily to drag estimation above 500 km. Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-OO, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia70 over a wide range of F10.7 Considering the two regimes together, NRLMSISE-00 achieves an improvement over both MSISE-90 and Jacchia-70 by incorporating advantages of each.

abstract = {We formulate a numerical method to derive the spectrum of the parent electrons from the hard X-ray spectrum produced in optically thin bremsstrahlung. The method can utilize any form for the bremsstrahlung cross sections, and it provides accurate estimates of uncertainties in the derived electron spectrum based on uncertainties in the photon measurements. This method is applied to test photon spectra, as well as to hard X-ray spectra of the 27 June, 1980 solar flare which was observed by high spectral resolution detectors. Future measurements with much more sensitive detectors will enable this method to be used to derive detailed, accurate flare electron spectra. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The Balloon Array for Radiation belt Relativistic Electron Losses\n(BARREL) mission of opportunity working in tandem with the Van Allen\nProbes was designed to study the loss of radiation belt electrons to the\nionosphere and upper atmosphere. BARREL is also sensitive to X-rays from\nother sources. During the second BARREL campaign, the Sun produced an\nX-class flare followed by a solar energetic particle event (SEP)\nassociated with the same active region. Two days later on 9 January\n2014, the shock generated by the coronal mass ejection (CME) originating\nfrom the active region hits the Earth while BARREL was in a close\nconjunction with the Van Allen Probes. Time History Events and\nMacroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite observed the\nimpact of the interplanetary CME (ICME) shock near the magnetopause, and\nthe Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) were on\neither side of the BARREL/Van Allen Probe array. The solar\ninterplanetary magnetic field was not ideally oriented to cause a\nsignificant geomagnetic storm, but compression from the shock impact led\nto the loss of radiation belt electrons. We propose that an azimuthal\nelectric field impulse generated by magnetopause compression caused\ninward electron transport and minimal loss. This process also drove\nchorus waves, which were responsible for most of the precipitation\nobserved outside the plasmapause. Observations of hiss inside the\nplasmapause explain the absence of loss at this location. ULF waves were\nfound to be correlated with the structure of the precipitation. We\ndemonstrate how BARREL can monitor precipitation following an ICME-shock\nimpact at Earth in a cradle-to-grave view; from flare, to SEP, to\nelectron precipitation.},

In this chapter, we describe these effects and the physics behind them. We then discuss modeling techniques to calculate these effects, including scaling and Monte Carlo techniques. We next describe the diagnostic techniques used to detect atmospheric effects of precipitation; these include space-based and balloon-based particle and X-ray measurements, ground-based optical detection, and ground-based radar, riometer, and subionospheric very-low-frequency (VLF) remote sensing of the D-region electron density disturbance. Finally, we describe future experiments and observations that will help to improve quantification of energetic precipitation fluxes and spectra.},

abstract = {The Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)-Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma (ECT) suite contains an innovative complement of particle instruments to ensure the highest quality measurements ever made in the inner magnetosphere and radiation belts. The coordinated RBSP-ECT particle measurements, analyzed in combination with fields and waves observations and state-of-the-art theory and modeling, are necessary for understanding the acceleration, global distribution, and variability of radiation belt electrons and ions, key science objectives of NASA's Living With a Star program and the Van Allen Probes mission. The RBSP-ECT suite consists of three highly-coordinated instruments: the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) sensor, and the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT). Collectively they cover, continuously, the full electron and ion spectra from one eV to 10's of MeV with sufficient energy resolution, pitch angle coverage and resolution, and with composition measurements in the critical energy range up to 50 keV and also from a few to 50 MeV/nucleon. All three instruments are based on measurement techniques proven in the radiation belts. The instruments use those proven techniques along with innovative new designs, optimized for operation in the most extreme conditions in order to provide unambiguous separation of ions and electrons and clean energy responses even in the presence of extreme penetrating background environments. The design, fabrication and operation of ECT spaceflight instrumentation in the harsh radiation belt environment ensure that particle measurements have the fidelity needed for closure in answering key mission science questions. ECT instrument details are provided in companion papers in this same issue.},

@article{Smith1995a,
abstract = {In December 1990, a set of liquid-nitrogen-cooled germanium hard X-ray and gamma-ray spectrometers was flown aboard a high-altitude balloon from McMurdo, Antarctica, for solar, astrophysical, and terrestrial observations. This flight was the first circumnavigation ({\textasciitilde}9-day duration) of the Antarctic continent by a large (800,000-cubic-meter) balloon. Bremsstrahlung hard X-ray emission extending up to {\textasciitilde}300 keV, from the precipitation of high-energy electrons, was observed on six separate occasions over the auroral zone, all during low geomagnetic activity (Kp<=2+). All events were consistent with emission at the trapping boundary; observations over the polar cap showed no precipitation. We present the first high-resolution ($\Delta$E{\textasciitilde}2 keV/full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectra of this hard X-ray emission in the energy range 20-300 keV. The observed count spectra are deconvolved by model-independent techniques to photon spectra and then the precipitating electron spectra. The spectral hardness shows an inverse relation with L as extremely effective in characterizing electron precipitation if coupled with imaging capability.},

@article{Robinson1989,
abstract = {The precipitating kiloelectronvolt electrons in the auroral zone that produce enhanced E-region ionization also produce bremsstrahlung X-rays. The spectral distribution of the emitted X-rays contains information from which the energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons may be inferred. Modeling of the interaction of auroral electrons with the atmosphere shows that the flux F of vertically-emitted X-rays as a function of energy K is given approximately by F(K) = g1(K) ∫ K ∞ (E - K)J(E)dE where J(E) is the differential flux of electrons in the energy range E - E + dE and g1(K) is a modified X-ray production function. With this functional form for the production function the quantity F(K) g1(K) is an exponential if the electron distribution is exponential. Thus, by dividing the observed X-ray fluxes at energy K by g1(K) and fitting the result to an exponential function, the average energy and energy flux of the electron distribution can be determined directly. The technique is especially useful for determining ionospheric properties that depend on the integral of the electron fluxes, for example, the total energy flux, the E-region peak density and the height-integrated electrical conductances. The best-fit exponential electron spectrum yields values for these parameters that are very nearly the same as the values computed from the actual spectrum, even though the actual spectrum may deviate substantially from an exponential. Accurate knowledge of the function g1 (K) is important in applying the technique to observations. For X-ray fluxes emitted at an escape angle of 180° from the nadir direction and assuming an isotroplc distribution of incident electrons g1(K) is approximately equal to 1.96 × 10-5 K-1.9 when energies are expressed in kiloelectronvolts. The values derived here for g1(K) agree well with those derived from simultaneous measurements of electron fluxes and resulting X-ray bremsstrahlung emission. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

@article{Anderson1960,
abstract = {Data from a long-duration balloon flight at 35-km height over the auroral zone during August 1959 showed that only very small fluxes of energetic X rays accompany visible auroras at this latitude. The maximum observed photon flux above 25 kev during a bright aurora was 2.5 cm?2 sec?1. Much larger fluxes, up to 40 cm?2 sec?1, preceded two active visible displays by about half an hour. On August 17 and 18 X-ray influxes were observed for several hours during the daytime. From Explorer VI data these are believed to be associated with the filling-up of the outer radiation belt after a geomagnetic storm. The scintillation counter employed permitted a determination of the X-ray energy spectrum at 6 g cm?2 depth from 25 to 300 kev on this and several other flights. From an analysis given here the parent electron spectrum is derived and found to be extremely steep. Typically, the ratio of the differential photon intensity at 30 kev to that at 160 kev is 350 to 1. Other balloon flights during August 1959 show that a large loss of electrons having energy >25 kev is occurring even on magnetically rather quiet days.},
